Where is Rick and Morty season 3?

[/u/rick_bot_number_3] does not know but it does like pointing out the production
 time differences between season 2 and 3 on [/r/RickAndMorty].

For info how the bot determines the time difference see the post [Season Three is not Late].

Like the bot? Toss me a Schmeckle (or part of one): `1C55DzMDvTMHQ2o3HUQtHex5EoPKi1Et17`.

- The Python dependencies are lazily put into `requirements.txt`.
- Environment variables needed to operate the bot are listed in `app.json`.
- The entry point is `src/main.py`.
- Follow PEP-8 with 120 characters per line instead of 80.
- Do not be a Tammy.
